    \end{enumerate}
\item %solution 3
    There are $50$ cards.  They are all even.\\
    All even numbers that are also multiples of $5$ are multiples of $10$ $(10,~ 20, \ldots, 100)$.\\
    There are $10$ of them.\\
    Therefore, the probability is $\frac{10}{50} = \frac{1}{5}$.

\item %solution 1
    Before we answer the questions we first work out how many blocks there are in total. This gives us the sample space\\
    $n(S) = 24 + 32 + 41 + 19$\\
	 $= 116$
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{(\alph*)} ]

    \item The probability that a block is purple is:\\
    $P(\mbox{purple}) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}\\
     P(\mbox{purple}) = \frac{24}{116}\\
     P(\mbox{purple}) = 0,21$

    \item The probability that a block is either purple or white is:\\
    $P(\mbox{purple} \cup \mbox{white}) = P(\mbox{purple}) + P(\mbox{white}) - P(\mbox{purple} \cap \mbox{white})\\
    = \frac{24}{116} + \frac{41}{116} - \frac{24}{116} \times \frac{41}{116}\\
    = 0,64$

    \item Since one block cannot be two colours the probability of this event is $0$.

    \item We first work out the probability that a block is orange:\\
    $P(\mbox{orange}) = \frac{32}{116}
	       = 0,28$\\
    The probability that a block is not orange is:\\
    $P(\mbox{not orange}) = 1 - 0,28\\
		   = 0,72$

We calculate the total number of pupils at the school:\\
$6 + 2 + 5 + 7 + 4 + 6 = 30$
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{(\alph*)} ]
    \item The total number of female children is $6 + 5 + 4 = 15$.\\
    The probability of a randomly selected child being female is:\\
    $P(\mbox{female}) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}\\
     P(\mbox{female}) = \frac{15}{30}\\
     P(\mbox{female}) = 0,5$

    \item The probability of a randomly selected child being a 4 year old male is:\\
    $P(\mbox{male}) = \frac{7}{30}\\
	      = 0,23$

    \item There are $6 + 2 + 5 + 7 = 20$ children aged 3 or 4.\\
    The probability of a randomly selected child being either 3 or 4 is:\\
    $\frac{20}{30} = 0,67$

    \item A child cannot be both 3 and 4, so the probability is $0$.

    \item This is the same as a randomly selected child being either 3 or 4 and so is $0,67$.

    \item The probability of a child being either 3 or female is:\\
    $P(3 \cup \mbox{female}) = P(3) + P(\mbox{female}) - P(3 \cap \mbox{female})\\
		      = \frac{10}{30} + 0,5 - \frac{10}{30} \times \frac{15}{30}\\

    The probability of drawing a disc that ends with $5$ is:\\
    $P(5) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}\\
     P(5) = \frac{9}{85}\\
     P(5) = 0,11$

    \item The set of all discs that are multiples of $3$ is: $\{3$; $6$; $ 9$; $ 12$; $ 15$; $ 18$; $ 21$; $ 24$; $ 27$; $ 30$; $ 33$; $ 36$; $ 39$; $ 42$; $ 45$; $ 48$; $ 51$; $ 54$; $ 57$; $ 60$; $ 63$; $ 66$; $ 69$; $ 72$; $ 75$; $ 78$; $ 81$; $ 84\}$. This has $28$ elements.\\
 
    The probability of drawing a disc that is a multiple of $3$ is:
    $P(3_m) = \frac{28}{85}
	    = 0,33$

    \item The set of all discs that are multiples of $6$ is: $\{6$; $ 12$; $ 18$; $ 24$; $ 30$; $ 36$; $ 42$; $ 48$; $ 54$; $ 60$; $ 66$; $ 72$; $ 78$; $ 84\}$. This set has $14$ elements.
    The probability of drawing a disc that is a multiple of $6$ is:\\
    $P(6_m) = \frac{14}{85}\\
	    = 0,16$

    \item There is only one element in this set and so the probability of drawing $65$ is:\\
    $P(65) = \frac{1}{85}\\
	   = 0,01$

    \item The set of all discs that is a multiple of $5$ is: $\{5$; $ 10$; $ 15$; $ 20$; $ 25$; $ 30$; $ 35$; $ 40$; $ 45$; $ 50$; $ 55$; $ 60$; $ 65$; $ 70$; $ 75$; $ 80$; $ 85\}$. This set contains $17$ elements. Therefore the number of discs that are not multiples of $5$ is: $85 − 17 = 68$.\\
   
    The probability of drawing a disc that is not a multiple of $5$ is:\\
    $P(\mbox{not }5_m) = \frac{68}{85}\\
	       = 0,80$

    \item In part b), we worked out the probability for a disc that is a multiple of $3$. Now we work out the number of elements in the set of all discs that are multiples of $4$: $\{4$; $ 8$; $ 12$; $ 16$; $ 20$; $ 24$; $ 28$; $ 32$; $ 36$; $ 40$; $ 44$; $ 48$; $ 52$; $ 56$; $ 60$; $ 64$; $ 68$; $ 72$; $ 76$; $ 80$; $ 84\}$. This has $28$ elements.\\
    
    The probability that a disc is a multiple of either $3$ or $4$ is:\\
    $P(3_m \cup 4_m) = P(3_m) + P(4_m) - P(3_m \cap 4_m)\\
    = 0,33 + \frac{28}{85} - 0,33 \times \frac{28}{85}\\
    = 0,55$
    
    \item The set of all discs that are a multiples of $2$ and $6$ is the same as the set of all discs that are a multiple of $6$. Therefore the probability of drawing a disc that is both a multiple of $2$ and $6$ is:
 
    $0,16$
    
    \item There is only $1$ element in this set and so the probability is $0,01$.

\item In a survey at Lwandani's Secondary School $80$ people were questioned to find out how many read the Sowetan and how many read the Daily Sun newspaper or both. The survey revealed that $45$ read the Daily Sun, $30$ read the Sowetan and $10$ read neither. Use a Venn diagram to find the percentage of people that read:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep, label=\textbf{(\alph*)} ]
