\chapter{Probability}


We use probability to describe uncertain events. When you accidentally
drop a slice of bread, you don't know if it's going to fall with the
buttered side facing upwards or downwards. When your favourite sports
team plays a game, you don't know whether they will win or not. When
the weatherman says that there is a $40\%$ chance of rain tomorrow, you
may or may not end up getting wet.  Uncertainty presents itself to
some degree in every event that occurs around us and in every decision
that we make.\par

We will see in this chapter that all of these uncertainties can be
described using the rules of probability theory and that we can make
definite conclusions about uncertain processes.\par

We'll use three examples of uncertain processes to help you understand
the meanings of the different words used in probability theory: tossing
a coin, rolling dice, and a soccer match.\par

\Definition{Experiment}{An experiment refers to an uncertain process.}

\Definition{Outcome}{An outcome of an experiment is a single
  result of that experiment.}

\begin{figure}[H]
\textbf{Experiment 1} A coin is tossed and it lands with either
  heads (H) or tails (T) facing upwards. An example outcome of tossing
  a coin is that it lands with heads facing up:

  dots added up. An example outcome of rolling two dice:

%   \caption{An example outcome of rolling two dice.}

\begin{figure}[H]
  \textbf{Experiment 3} Two teams play a soccer match and we are
  interested in the final score. An example outcome of a soccer match:

\end{figure}

\Definition{Sample space}{The sample space of an experiment is
  the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. The sample
  space is denoted with the symbol \(S\) and the size of the sample
  space (the total number of possible outcomes) is denoted with
  \(n(S)\).}

Even though we are usually interested in the outcome of an experiment,
we also need to know what the other outcomes could have been. Let's
have a look at the sample spaces of each of our three experiments.

\paragraph{Experiment 1} Since a coin can land in one of only two ways
(we will ignore the possibility that the coin lands on its edge), the
sample space is the set \(S=\{\mbox{H}; \mbox{T}\}\). The size of the sample space of the coin toss
is \(n(S)=2\):

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{scope}[xshift=-1.5cm]
      \coinheads
    \end{scope}
    \begin{scope}[xshift=+1.5cm]
      \cointails
    \end{scope}
    \draw (-3, -1.5) rectangle (3, 1.5) node[anchor=south east] {$S$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
%   \caption{Sample space of a coin toss.}
\end{figure} 

\paragraph{Experiment 2} Each of the dice can land on a number from $1$
to $6$. In this experiment the sample space of all possible outcomes is
every possible combination of the $6$ numbers on the first die with the
$6$ numbers on the second die. This gives a total of \(n(S) = 6 \times 6
= 36\) possible outcomes. The figure below shows all of the outcomes
in the sample space of rolling two dice:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{scope}[scale=0.5]
  \foreach \x in {1, ..., 6} {
    \foreach \y in {1, ..., 6} {
      \pgfmathparse{15*rand} \let\rot\pgfmathresult
      \makediesmall{\x}{shift={(4cm*\x-0.66cm,-2cm*\y)},rotate=\rot}
      \pgfmathparse{15*rand} \let\rot\pgfmathresult
      \makediesmall{\y}{shift={(4cm*\x+0.66cm,-2cm*\y)},rotate=\rot}
    }
  }
  \draw[thick] (2.5cm-0.66cm, -0.5cm) rectangle (25.5cm+0.66cm, -13.5cm);
  \draw (25.5cm+0.66cm, -0.5cm) node[anchor=south east] {$S$};
  \end{scope}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
%   \caption{Sample space of rolling two dice.}
\end{figure} 

\paragraph{Experiment 3} Each soccer team can get an integer score
from $0$ upwards. Usually we don't expect a score to go much higher than
$5$ goals, but there is no reason why this cannot happen. So the sample
space of this experiment consists of all possible combinations of two
non-negative integers. The figure below shows all of the
possibilities. Since we do not limit the score of a team, this sample
space is infinitely large:

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \foreach \x in {0, ..., 3} {
      \foreach \y in {0, ..., 3} {
        \draw (\x*1.5cm,-\y) node {\x\ --\ \y};
      }
    }
    \foreach \x in {0, ..., 2} {
      \draw (\x*1.5cm,-3.67cm) node {$\vdots$};
    }
    \foreach \y in {0, ..., 2} {
      \draw (5.5cm,-\y) node {$\cdots$};
    }
    \draw (5.5cm,-3.67cm) node {$\ddots$};

    \draw[thick] (-0.75cm, -4.17cm) -- (-0.75, 0.5cm) -- (6cm, 0.5cm);
    \draw (6cm, 0.5cm) node[anchor=south east] {$S$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
%   \caption{Sample space of the final score of a soccer match.}
\end{figure}

\Definition{Event}{An event is a specific set of outcomes of an
  experiment that you are interested in. An event is denoted with the
  letter \(E\) and the number of outcomes in the event with \(n(E)\).}

\paragraph{Experiment 1} Let's say that we would like the coin to land
heads up. Here the event contains a single outcome:
\(E=\{\mbox{H}\}\), \(n(E)=1\).

\paragraph{Experiment 2} Let's say that we are interested in the sum
of the dice being $8$. In this case the event set is
$E=\{($\raisebox{-2pt}{\begin{tikzpicture}
  \begin{scope}[scale=0.333]

The size of the event set is \(n(E)=5\).

%We can also represent this visually by drawing a line around the
%outcomes in which we are interested.

\paragraph{Experiment 3} We would like to know whether the first team
will win. For this event to happen the first score must be greater
than the second.
\[E=\{(1;0);(2;0);(2;1);(3;0);(3;1);(3;2);\ldots\}\]
This event set is infinitely large.

\section{Theoretical probability}
\Definition{Probability}{A probability is a real number between
  $0$ and $1$ that describes how likely it is that an event will occur.}
\par
It can also be described as a percentage (a probability of $0,75$ can be written as $75 \%~$) or as fraction ($0,75$ can also be written as $\frac{3}{4}$).
\begin{itemize}
\item A probability of $0$ means that an event will never occur.
\item A probability of $1$ means that an event will always occur.
\item A probability of $0,5$ means that an event will occur half the
  time, or $1$ time out of every $2$.
\end{itemize}

When all of the possible outcomes of an experiment have an equal
chance of occurring, we can compute the exact theoretical probability
of an event. The probability of an event is the ratio between the
number of outcomes in the event set and the number of possible
outcomes in the sample space.
\[P(E) = \frac{n(E)}{n(S)}\]

Experiment 2: $P(E) = \dfrac{n(E)}{n(S)} = \dfrac{5}{36} = 0,13\dot{8}$\\

}
\end{wex}

Note that we do not consider the theoretical probability of the third
experiment. The third experiment is different from the first two in an
important way, namely that all possible outcomes (all final scores)
are not equally likely. For example, we know that a soccer score of
$1$--$1$ is quite common, while a score of $11$--$15$ is very, very
rare. Because all outcomes are not equally likely, we cannot use the
ratio between \(n(E)\) and \(n(S)\) to compute the theoretical
probability of a team winning. 

% \IFact{The record for the total number of goals scored by both teams in the FIFA World Cup is $12$. This
% was achieved in $1954$ in the match between Austria and Switzerland, where the final score was $7$--$5$.}

\section{Relative frequency}

\Definition{Relative frequency}{The relative frequency of an event is
  defined as the number of times that the event occurs during
  experimental trials, divided by the total number of trials
  conducted.}

The relative frequency is not a theoretical quantity, but an
experimental one. We have to repeat an experiment a number of times
and count how many times the outcome of the trial is in the event
set. Because it is experimental, it is possible to get a different
relative frequency every time that we repeat an experiment.\par

From the last entry in this table we can now easily read the relative
frequency after $30$ trials, namely $13/30 = 0,4\dot{3}$. The relative
frequency is close to the theoretical probability of $0,5$. In general,
the relative frequency of an event tends to get closer to the theoretical
probability of the event as we perform more trials.\\
\\
A much better way to summarise the table of relative frequencies is in
a graph: 

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{Gr10-Probability-images/coin_toss_trials.pdf}
  \end{center}
%   \caption{Plot of the relative frequency of observing heads, $f$,
%     after having completed $t$ coin tosses.}
\end{figure}

\noindent The graph above is the plot of the relative frequency of observing heads, $f$,
after having completed $t$ coin tosses. It was generated from the table of numbers above
by plotting the number of trials that have been completed, $t$, on the
$x$-axis and the relative frequency, $f$, on the $y$-axis. In the
beginning (after a small number of trials) the relative frequency
fluctuates a lot around the theoretical probability at $0,5$, which is
shown with a dashed line. As the number of trials increases, the
relative frequency fluctuates less and gets closer to the theoretical
probability.

\end{wex}

%\paragraph{Experiment 2} We roll the two dice $100$ times and observe
%whether the sum of the dice equals $8$. It turns out that our event
%occurs $15$ times during the experiment. From this we can calculate the
%relative frequency as
%\[\frac{15}{100}=0,15\]
%This is close to the theoretical probability, which we compute earlier
%as $0,13\dot{8}$.

\begin{wex}{Relative frequency and theoretical probability}

{In this experiment, each trial takes the form of Team 1 playing a

  \westep{Count the number of positive outcomes}

  We are interested in the event where Team 1 wins. From the table
  above we see that this happens $3$ times.

  \westep{Compute the relative frequency}

  The total number of trials is $10$. This means that the relative
  frequency of the event is \[\frac{3}{10} = 0,3\]
}
\end{wex}

It is important to understand the difference between the theoretical
probability of an event and the observed relative frequency of the
event in experimental trials. The theoretical probability is a number
that we can compute if we have enough information about the
experiment. If each possible outcome in the sample space is
equally likely, we can count the number of outcomes in the event set
and the number of outcomes in the sample space to compute the
theoretical probability.\par

The relative frequency depends on the sequence of outcomes that we
observe while doing a statistical experiment. The relative frequency
can be different every time we redo the experiment. The more trials we
run during an experiment, the closer the observed relative frequency
of an event will get to the theoretical probability of the event.\par

So why do we need statistical experiments if we have theoretical
probabilities? In some cases, like our soccer experiment, it is
difficult or impossible to compute the theoretical probability of an
event. Since we do not know exactly how likely it is that one soccer
team will score goals against another, we can never compute the
theoretical probability of events in soccer. In such cases we can
still use the relative frequency to estimate the theoretical
probability, by running experiments and counting the number of
positive outcomes.\par

\section{Venn diagrams}
A Venn diagram is a graphical way of representing the relationships
between sets. In each Venn diagram a set is represented by a closed
curve. The region inside the curve represents the elements that
belong to the set, while the region outside the curve represents the
elements that are excluded from the set.\par

Venn diagrams are helpful for thinking about probability since we deal
with different sets. Consider two events, $A$ and $B$, in a sample
space $S$.
%  Figure~\ref{fig:venndiagrams} 
The diagram below shows the possible ways in which the event
sets can overlap, represented using Venn diagrams:\\

  all of the elements that are in at least one of the two sets. The

\Definition{Intersection}{The intersection of two sets is a new set

\section{Probability identities}
\begin{equation*}
 P(S)=1
\end{equation*}


By definition, the sample space contains all possible outcomes of an
experiment. So we know that the probability of observing an outcome
from the sample space is $1$.

\begin{equation*}
 P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
\end{equation*}


We will prove this identity using the Venn diagrams given above.

% \ref{fig:venn_union_intersection}
For each of the $4$ terms in the
union and intersection identity, we can draw the Venn diagram and then
add and subtract the different diagrams. The area of a region
represents its probability.

We will do this for the first column of the Venn diagram figure given previously% \ref{fig:venn_union_intersection}
. You should also try it for the
other columns.

\section{Mutually exclusive events}
\Definition{Mutually exclusive events}{Two events are called mutually
  exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time. Whenever an outcome
  of an experiment is in the first event it can not also be in the
  second event, and vice versa.}

Another way of saying this is that the two event sets, $A$ and $B$,
cannot have any elements in common, or $P(A \cap B) = \emptyset$
(where $\emptyset$ denotes the empty set).

We have already seen the Venn diagrams of mutually exclusive events in
the middle column of the Venn diagrams provided on page \pageref{fig:venn_union_intersection}.

% Figure \ref{fig:venn_union_intersection}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \input{Gr10-Probability-images/venn_union_intersection3}
\end{figure}

From this figure you can see that the intersection has no
elements. You can also see that the probability of the union is the
sum of the probabilities of the events.
\[P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\]
This relationship is true for mutually
exclusive events only.

\section{Complementary events}

\Definition{Complementary set}{The complement of a set, $A$, is a
  different set that contains all of the elements that are not in
  $A$. We write the complement of $A$ as $A'$, or
  sometimes as ``$\mbox{not }(A)$''.}

For an experiment with sample space $S$ and an event $A$ we can derive
some identities for complementary events. Since every element in $A$ is not in $A'$, we know
  that complementary events are mutually exclusive.
\begin{equation*}
 A \cap A' = \emptyset
\end{equation*}


Since every element in the sample space is either in $A$ or in
  $A'$, the union of complementary events covers the
  sample space.
\begin{equation*}
A \cup A' = S
\end{equation*}
From the previous two identities, we also know that the
  probabilities of complementary events sum to $1$.

\begin{equation*}
P(A) + P(A') = P(A \cup A') = P(S) = 1

\begin{itemize}
\item An experiment refers to an uncertain process.

\item An outcome of an experiment is a single
  result of that experiment.

\item The sample space of an experiment is
  the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. The sample
  space is denoted with the symbol $S$ and the size of the sample
  space (the total number of possible outcomes) is denoted with
  $n(S)$.

\item An event is a specific set of outcomes of an
  experiment that you are interested in. An event is denoted with the
  letter $E$ and the number of outcomes in the event with $n(E)$.

\item A probability is a real number between
  $0$ and $1$ that describes how likely it is that an event will occur.
\begin{itemize}
\item A probability of $0$ means that an event will never occur.
\item A probability of $1$ means that an event will always occur.
\item A probability of $0,5$ means that an event will occur half the
  time, or $1$ time out of every $2$.
\end{itemize}

\item A probability can also be written as a percentage or as a fraction.

\item The relative frequency of an event is
  defined as the number of times that the event occurs during
  experimental trials, divided by the total number of trials
  conducted.

\item The union of two sets is a new set that contains
  all of the elements that are in at least one of the two sets. The
  union is written as $A \cup B$.

\item The intersection of two sets is a new set
  that contains all of the elements that are in both sets. The
  intersection is written as $A \cap B$.

\item The probability of sample space:  $P(S)=1$.

\item Union and intersection: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$.


\item Mutually exclusive events are two events that cannot occur at the same time. Whenever an outcome
  of an experiment is in the first event, it can not also be in the
  second event.


\item The complement of a set, $A$, is a
  different set that contains all of the elements that are not in
  $A$. We write the complement of $A$ as $A'$, or
  sometimes as ``$\mbox{not}(A)$''.

\item Complementary events are mutually exclusive: $A \cap A' = \emptyset$.


\item Complementary events cover the sample space: $A \cup A' = S$.


\item Probabilities of complementary events sum to $1$: $P(A) + P(A') = P(A \cup A') = P(S) = 1$.
